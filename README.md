# HPG
HPG is an open source digital electronic currency based on block chain technology of the Global Eco-environmental Protection Association. Huanda coin is called HPG for short. Its origin is H for Huanda. P is the English for protection: Protect abbreviation, G is the English abbreviation for global ecological environment. HPG also symbolizes the protection of global ecological environment and calls for global protection of ecological environment. Everyone has a responsibility.  Starting from the essence of Huanda coin, the essence of Huanda coin is actually a special solution generated by a complex algorithm. Special solutions refer to a group of finite solutions that can be obtained by a system of equations. Every special solution can solve the equation and is unique. In the analogy of banknotes, Huanda coin is the crown number of a banknote. If you know the crown number of a banknote, you have the banknote. The process of mining is to continuously seek the special solutions of this equation system through huge amount of calculation. This equation system is designed to have only 21 million special solutions, so the upper limit of Huanda coin is 2 billion.
